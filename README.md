# Food_Book_Architecture_Components
It allows us to display values such as calories,  carbohydrates, fats and proteins according to the names of foods. Values are given as an example. The data created on Github has been transferred to the user using RESTful API. MVVM Design Pattern are used. Room and glide libraries are included.

### Technology / Others
- This app made %100 with  [Kotlin](https://developer.android.com/kotlin)
- [Navigation Componenet](https://developer.android.com/guide/navigation):Navigation refers to the interactions that allow users to navigate across, into, and back out from the different pieces of content within your app. Android Jetpack's Navigation component helps you implement navigation, from simple button clicks to more complex patterns, such as app bars and the navigation drawer.
- [ViewModel](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel) : The ViewModel class is a business logic or screen level state holder. It exposes state to the UI and encapsulates related business logic. Its principal advantage is that it caches state and persists it through configuration changes. This means that your UI doesn’t have to fetch data again when navigating between activities, or following configuration changes, such as when rotating the screen.
- [Livedata](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/livedata) : LiveData is an observable data holder class. Unlike a regular observable, LiveData is lifecycle-aware, meaning it respects the lifecycle of other app components, such as activities, fragments, or services. This awareness ensures LiveData only updates app component observers that are in an active lifecycle state.
- [MVVM ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model–view–viewmodel): Model–view–viewmodel (MVVM) is an architectural pattern in computer software that facilitates the separation of the development of the graphical user interface (GUI; the view)—be it via a markup language or GUI code—from the development of the business logic or back-end logic (the model) such that the view is not dependent upon any specific model platform.
- [Fragments ](https://developer.android.com/guide/fragments): A Fragment represents a reusable portion of your app's UI. A fragment defines and manages its own layout, has its own lifecycle, and can handle its own input events. Fragments can't live on their own. They must be hosted by an activity or another fragment. The fragment’s view hierarchy becomes part of, or attaches to, the host’s view hierarchy.
- [Room ](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/releases/room): The Room persistence library provides an abstraction layer over SQLite to allow for more robust database access while harnessing the full power of SQLite.
- [Glide ](https://github.com/bumptech/glide): A library for imageView. Glide is a fast and efficient open source media management and image loading framework for Android that wraps media decoding, memory and disk caching, and resource pooling into a simple and easy to use interface.
